Breaking Game
========
This is a MOD for personal use, however, I am uploading it in case anyone else is interested in the same changes.

The main idea of this MOD is to use as much as possible what already exists in the base game or in other MODs, while I learn to program what occurs to me, the closest to what occurs to me.

The code contains many comments in Spanish and it is easy to follow it in case you want to make those changes or customize the MOD.

Some options of this MOD work independently, so they can be activated without the others and this one will affect all objective elements (objects, entities, players or others), EVERYONE. In the event that the option needs another to function, it is indicated within [ ], and only the objects of the required option will be affected.

Compact objects
--------
Creates an item that represents the indicated amount of the original item. This option is designed for logistics, that is, the resulting objects will not have functionality.

Improve compacted objects [ Compact objects ]
--------
The new objects will be able to see some characteristic increased in the same amount of objects used in the compacted one. For example, if 50 coals whose combustion value equals 4MJ are compacted, then the new coal will have a combustion value of 200MJ.
